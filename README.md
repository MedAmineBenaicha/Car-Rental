## Project Description 
Car rental is a service offered by professionals who own cars .This service consists for the customer to reserve and use a vehicle for a given period ranging from a few hours to several months. 

To improve the management of car rentals, be close to all customers and facilitate the rental process I was asked as a developper to a create a desktop application that will allow the managers of the agency to ensure better management of vehicles, customers and it will solve several problems of manual management.The application will be divided into two parts: a private part which groups together all the administrative tasks performed by the agency managers and a public part which allows the normal user manage the list of clients, cars, contracts, car parks and invoices. 
The application will have the following missions: 
- The ability to list and reserve a vehicle 
- Ensure all agency management: management of reservations, rental management, vehicle management, customer management and parks management.
- Search, modification and easy access to information relating to agency staff. 
- Easy communication between clients and agency.
